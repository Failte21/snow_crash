# list level03 home

# an executable file owned by flag03 exists: level03, we run it

# Using ltrace, we find out that the program set the effective user id using setresuid()
# and then call echo using the system() function.

# We create a script echo that runs getflag() in /tmp and make it executable

# We change the path so that our fake echo will be called first

# We run ./level03 and get the token
